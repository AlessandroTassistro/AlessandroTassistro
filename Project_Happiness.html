</div>

    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">For my Social Media and Content Management class at IAAD, I had the task to <b>revamp the social identity of one of my favorite social media influencers, Progetto Happiness.</b> Created by Giuseppe Bertuccio D'Angelo, a 32-year-old originally from Messina, Progetto Happiness embodies a journey of personal and professional growth through travel, discovery, and relationships.

</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">

   The initial step in revitalizing the social identity for Progetto Happiness was to thoroughly understand the existing channels used for content dissemination. To achieve this, I conducted a <b>comprehensive SWOT analysis—assessing the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats associated with the current social media strategy.</b> The SWOT analysis provided a clear framework to recognize potential opportunities for growth, such as expanding into new social media platforms or incorporating more diverse content formats, and highlighted external threats like competitive channels. <br> <br>

</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">

   As part of the project to revamp the social identity of Progetto Happiness, I conducted an extensive <b>competitor analysis,</b> focusing on both the <b>Italian market and the international scene.</b> This analysis involved a  dive into the strategies employed by other channels that resonate within the same thematic areas of travel, personal growth, and cultural discovery. By examining these competitors, I was able to assess how they engage with their audiences, the types of content they produce, and the platforms they prioritize.<br> <br>

After scrutinizing these various channels, my goal was to identify market vacancies—opportunities where Progetto Happiness could uniquely position itself to capture audience attention.<br> <br>

    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">

  Starting from the insights collected from the first part of the analysis we defined the two main goals of the project:<br> <br>

<b><U>Make the Audience Global:</U></b> <br> 
Project Happiness is already starting to show signs of a shift to an international audience, we want to take these first tries to the next level.<br> <br>

<b><U>Give More Space to the Community:</U></b> <br> 
Project Happiness was born to be useful to all the people of the world, it is time to involve them in the next step. <br> <br>

</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">

 To understand the situation better, the next step was to <b>indagate the current following of the page.</b> I did not just focus on a <b>quantitative target analysis, but also an integrated qualitative one.</b> The latter approach lead me to the creation of two psychographic segments.

</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">


After identifying market opportunities, the next step was to develop a <b>new creative concept</b> for Progetto Happiness, refining the tone of voice and devising a diverse content mix.         <br> <br>
        
The existing tone of voice for Project Happiness is clearly defined and effective; however, it requires <b>standardization across all touchpoints.</b>  <br> <br>

Project Happiness pages are envisioned as welcoming spaces where everyone feels safe and accepted. 
Therefore, the tone of voice should be <b>friendly, resembling the one used by an old friend. </b> <br> <br>

Simultaneously, Project Happiness should strive to maintain its current journalistic approach to longer storytelling. <br> <br>

Given the low popularity of the <b>blog and the inactivity of the newsletter, I decided to merge the two tools into one.<br> <br></b>

The newsletter will be <b>issued monthly</b> and it will cover various topics, primarily focusing on expanding upon the content of the previous week's videos’ and offering a preview of the upcoming content. <br> <br>

The newsletter will adopt a <b>traditional newspaper format,</b> featuring columns on recent events, food, travel, and technology, all unified by the central theme of happiness.<br> <br>

Here are some articles example: <br> <br>

<b><U>- Eating Happiness:<br></U></b>
The Joy of Eating Together<br>
Foods that Boost Mood<br>
The art of comfort food<br> <br>

<b><U>- Traveling to Happiness:<br></U></b>

LinkedIn will serve as a platform for Project Happiness to engage with other brands and creators for potential collaborations or to showcase partnerships. There will be two primary types of content:  <br> <br>

<b><U>- Sponsor-related content:<br></U></b>
The first type of content is dedicated to acknowledging and thanking the sponsors and partners of Project Happiness. It will detail their <b>contributions and the projects they have supported.</b> This section may also feature <b>interviews with sponsors, discussing their reasons for supporting the mission of Project Happiness</b> and the significance of promoting global happiness.<br> <br>

<b><U>- Infographic regarding data collected by the project:<br></U></b>
SThe second type of content will be a data-driven column that presents infographics and analyses related to happiness metrics from around the globe. <b>It will explore trends, scientific discoveries, and socio-economic factors that influence happiness levels worldwide and regionally.</b> This column aims to offer a <b>visually engaging and insightful examination</b> of what contributes to societies thriving while redirecting the Project Happiness’ content.<br> <br>
