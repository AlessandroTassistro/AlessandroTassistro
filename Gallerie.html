</div>

    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">For our group thesis at IAAD, we tackled the challenge of giving <b>a new identity to the Gallerie d'Italia app.</b> This museum, supported by San Paolo Bank, needed other than a refresh of its features and communication style; it also required a <b>digital marketing plan to boost its promotion.</b> Tasked by the bank, we crafted a strategy that not only highlighted the app’s new functionalities but also captured the unique essence of the Gallerie d'Italia. <b>Our goal was to make the app a must-have for visitors, enhancing their experience and keeping them engaged with the museum’s offerings.</b>

 <div id="section1"><div class="left-title">THE RESEARCH</div>
</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">

  For our Gallerie d'Italia app project, we started with a dive into the museum landscape, <b>looking into trends and other museum apps to see what was out there.</b> Recognizing our competition was key, and through this exploration, we were able to perform a detailed SWOT analysis. This helped us pinpoint three foundational pillars for our project.<br> <br>

  <div id="section1"><div class="left-title">THE PILLARS</div>
</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">

  These are the three pillars we followed:<br> <br>

<b><u>Digitalization:</u></b> Choosing digital solutions allows museums to reach new user needs and interests while increasing the accuracy.<br>
        - Tracking the user’s path lets museums drive the curation design. <br>
        - Sending push notifications is a good tool to create conversion.<br><br>
        
        
<b><u>Education:</u></b> New digital trends can help create a new way to enjoy culture.<br>
    - Gamification: the learning process becomes more engaging.<br>
 - Social Media Methods: these platforms portray how to make content addictive.<br>
    - FOMO: a great way to convert interest into action. <br><br>
        
<b><u>Visitors behaviours:</u></b> The visitor is now at the center, not in the exhibition.<br>
- Community: the visitor doesn’t move as an individual.<br>
- Intimacy: people feel intimacy with brands and it affects loyalty.<br>
- Sharing: the experience is more engaging when it’s shared with others.<br>

</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">

  We also took a close look at our target <b>audience—museum visitors</b> to better understand their needs and preferences. Through our research, we were able to define and create <b>three psychographic segments</b> that represent different visitor profiles.

    <div id="section1"><div class="left-title">THE NEW CONCEPT</div>
</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">

  <b>We, just like Gallerie d’Italia, are deeply convinced that art is not just about the masterpiece but the interaction between the artwork and the visitor.</b> <br><br>

Starting from this idea as well as aiming to redefine what is called art, we declined the app as a <b>permeable container</b> which is capable of accommodating people‘s perspectives, ready to be opened and shared with the public as art.

     <div id="section1"><div class="left-title">THE AMBIENT CAMPAIGN</div>
</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">

 One of the key outcomes of our application plan was the design of an <b>ambient marketing campaign.</b> <br><br>

The application will not be the only permeable box of the project, and in order to engage as many people as possible, <b>four boxes will be placed in integral parts of the cities, hosting the museum.</b> <br><br>

Internally, the boxes will feature <b>frames and screens</b> that offer users the opportunity to experience the city from a personal viewpoint and to engage in art creation. Other than framing the cities as masterpieces, this initiative will invite participants to <b>capture a picture that will be inspired by a weekly theme</b> provided by the gallery. These pictures will then be displayed in the screens and shared with the entire community of Gallerie d‘Italia. <br><br>

</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">

 As a part of the relaunch of the application, one key touchpoint will be the <b>museum's website.</b> We aspire to treat the new app as a piece of art itself, deserving the same spotlight as your exhibitions. <br><br>

The new landing page will be prominently featured and could be accessed through QR codes, social media links and browsers.<br><br>

    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">

 We decided to put the spotlight on the visitors of Gallerie d’Italia and also on <b>social networks.</b>

The content that will be shared will primarily be audiovisual, <b>including stories, reels and videos with some static posts</b> as well.

    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">

 <b>Out-of-home</b> advertising is essential for reaching residents in the cities where Gallerie d'Italia is located. This campaign highlights the opinions and experiences of people, symbolized by the diverse faces featured on the posters. Additionally, the out-of-home advertisements will encourage people to visit the mentioned installations, inviting them to explore and engage with the art firsthand.

</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">

A big part of the challenge was to take some features of the applications and introduce the new storytelling. Here are reported two of them.<br><br>   
        
        
        
        
        <u>- Audioguides </u><br>
        
        The first feature enhances your existing audio guide system by allowing users to add new content and information. To fully <b>capture the essence of what the artist intended to represent</b> in their works, we've incorporated natural sounds and effects into the audio guides, <b>transporting visitors to the very environment where the masterpieces were created.</b><br><br>
        
        
        Leveraging the beacon system and the existing map functionality in the Gallerie, the application will detect the visitor's location and play the appropriate sounds, providing an immersive and contextual experience.<br><br><br>
        
        
        
        
        
   <u>- Cloudwords:</u><br>
        
        
        As mentioned before, we aim to <b>collect visitors' opinions, particularly about the exhibitions.</b> Through the application, visitors will be able to leave feedback on 
each individual piece, expressing what it makes them feel. These opinions will then be compiled into a dynamic word cloud visible to everyone in the immersive room.<br><br>

The word cloud will take the shape of the most popular or <b>most loved piece of the exhibition,</b> creating a visually engaging and interactive experience for all visitors.
