    <div id="section1"><div class="left-title">THE PROBLEM</div>
</div>

    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">For my thesis at IAAD (Master in Digital Communication and Marketing), I chose to tackle a project that aims to improve the physical world using digital tools. In particular,<b> I was challenged by my professor to create a solution to marine littering that generates an emotional response from the everyday user.</b> <br><br>
           
    The first step in my project was to fully understand the problem at hand. I conducted thorough research and discovered the major types of trash contributing to marine littering. Among the results, one kind of trash was shown to be the most widespread: <b>microplastics.</b> These tiny plastic particles, less than 5 millimeters in size, originate from the breakdown of larger plastics and synthetic products. Microplastics permeate marine ecosystems and pose significant risks to marine life and human health by entering the food chain.<br> <br>
        
    According to data from conservation.org, twelve million metric tons of plastic find their way into our oceans every year, posing a critical threat to marine ecosystems.
    <b>How can we transform the concept of 'collecting a specific quantity of rubbish' into a clear, engaging message that not only highlights their commitment but also resonates with their audience? </b>

    <div id="section1"><div class="left-title">THE STRATEGY</div>
</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">In partnership with Ogyre, this project aims to create a <b>digital tool</b> specifically designed for brands to articulate and showcase their efforts in marine pollution reduction to their stakeholders and clients. The strategy involves developing a platform that translates quantitative data on waste collection into engaging, narrative-driven content that <b>highlights each brand's commitment to environmental stewardship.</b> This tool will be sold to brands looking to enhance their environmental responsibility profile and deepen stakeholder engagement through transparent communication.

                <div id="section1"><div class="left-title">THE TARGETS</div>
</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">In developing a digital tool for Ogyre that can be adopted by different brands to improve their environmental initiatives, it is crucial to start defining the primary <b>target audience. </b>This analysis is divided into two distinct categories: the brands <b>(business-to-business, B2B)</b> and the end users <b>(prosumers, B2C)</b> who will interact with the tool through these brands.<br><br>


<b>B2B target analysis</b> <br>
    When developing a digital tool with Ogyre to enhance environmental initiatives, it's crucial to target specific B2B groups within industries that significantly impact ocean pollution. The focus is on sectors such as <b>fashion and beauty, beverage companies, cigarette manufacturers, and fast food chains—each with a substantial environmental footprint and consumer reach.</b> These industries face unique sustainability challenges and opportunities: fashion brands might use the tool to promote sustainable practices, beverage companies could align it with recycling efforts, cigarette brands might encourage proper disposal of butts, and fast food chains could advocate for sustainable packaging and cleanup participation. These strategic alignments can significantly enhance each sector's environmental efforts while engaging a broader consumer base.<br><br>



<b>B2C target analysis</b> <br>
    When developing a digital tool in collaboration with Ogyre to promote sustainable practices and improve ocean conservation efforts, it is crucial to understand the end user, here referred to as the prosumer. This segment of the market analysis focus onto the <b>motivations, behaviors and preferences of individual users</b> who interact with the tool across various brands. These users are not simple consumers, but proactive participants (prosumers) whose actions and commitment determine the success of the digital tool.

This analysis is based on a targeted approach, starting with a <b>survey</b> conducted in an environmentally focused online community (Reddit). The survey was designed to assess the current level of engagement in digital charity projects, uncover the motivations behind that engagement, and identify barriers that may prevent participation.

           <div id="section1"><div class="left-title">THE HMW QUESTIONS</div>
</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">The responses from this survey were instrumental in identifying key areas where our digital tool could improve or innovate to better meet the needs of our users. Based on this  feedback, I formulated a series of <b>“How Might We” (HMW) questions</b>. Each HMW question addresses a distinct aspect of users' interaction and engagement with the digital tool, from enhancing the feeling of active participation and offering tangible rewards, to integrating the act of donating into users' daily routines and to guarantee transparency in the use of their contributions.<br><br>


<b><u>How Can We Make the Act of Doing Charity Shareable?</u></b><br>
<b><u>Problem:</u></b> Users feel detached from their contributions.<br>
<b><u>Insight:</u></b> Users are more motivated to donate when they can see and influence the outcomes of their contributions.<br>
<b><u>HMW:</u></b> How might we create a more interactive experience that allows users to see real-time results and participate in decision-making?<br><br>
        
        
<b><u>How Can We Make the User as a Part of the Project?</u></b><br>
<b><u>Problem:</u></b> Users find it difficult to share their charitable activities with their network.<br>
<b><u>Insight:</u></b> Users enjoy sharing their good deeds on social media, which can also encourage others to donate.<br>
<b><u>HMW:</u></b> How might we facilitate easy sharing of charitable activities that not only highlight individual contributions but also encourage participation?<br><br>
                
        
<b><u>How Can We Make the Act of Donating Part of the Usual Routine?</u></b><br>
<b><u>Problem:</u></b> Donating feels like a separate, sometimes burdensome task.<br>
<b><u>Insight:</u></b> Users are more likely to donate regularly if the process is integrated into their activities and routines.<br>
<b><u>HMW:</u></b> How might we integrate donation options into everyday digital and physical routines to make giving as habitual as checking the weather?<br><br>        
        
<b><u>How Can We Make the Transparency and Impact Reporting?</u></b><br>
<b><u>Problem:</u></b> Users are skeptical about where their money goes and the impact it has.<br>
<b><u>Insight:</u></b> Trust is significantly enhanced when users receive detailed reports about the use and outcomes of their donations.<br>
<b><u>HMW:</u></b> How might we utilize digital tools to provide real-time impact reporting that builds trust and transparency?<br><br>
