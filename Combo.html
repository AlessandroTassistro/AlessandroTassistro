</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text"><a href="https://thisiscombo.com/it">Combo</a> is a modern hostel chain where art meets a new idea of hospitality. During my time there I was one of the three main representatives of the marketing department. My duties regarded mainly the <b>production and diffusion of graphic supports</b> used by the four different locations based in Torino, Milano, Venezia, and Bologna.

</div>
        <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text"> 
        As part of the marketing department, I helped with the <b>creation and advertising of exhibitions, parties, and Dj sets.</b> Talking with artists, musicians, and yoga instructors was only part of my job, I was also in charge of the making of the supports used to promote the events.

</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text"><b>The making of an editorial plan and copywriting were the main tasks I followed regarding the brand's social network.</b> Combo is a place where everybody is welcomed, the same can be said for its accounts. We used a friendly and engaging tone of voice putting the spotlight on the beautiful spaces and the enjoyable events that take place every day.

</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">In an always-changing environment like Combo a <b>camera was essential to capture new plates, and friendly faces.</b> I also usually <b>helped during photo shooting</b> where I decorated the different environments.

                <div id="section1"><div class="left-title">SIMPLE AND BIG TASKS</div>
</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">Being the only graphic designer I was the sole responsible for the production of simple elements like <b>restaurant menus and merchandising.</b> In the meantime, I kept updating the already existing brand guidelines in order to keep up with the latest trends and innovations. The biggest task I was assigned was the <b>complete renovation of the latest location's wayfinding,</b> where I worked in collaboration with the external design studio “LeftLoft”.
